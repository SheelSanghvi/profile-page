profile page using html,cssand bootstrap
TASK 1:
  Made a profile page using html and css. It includes a profile picture, contact details, personal details, academic details, skills and extracurricular achievements. I added special effects like shadow inline and outline, icons with hyperlinks to the respective websites, opacity to the profile picture when cursor hovers on it.Also, clicking the email directs you to the email app available and clicking the phone no. directs you to the dialer or any other appropriate app. For the icons I used a stylesheet from the link https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.css. Rest all has been written from scratch.Open the file named "profile.html". the css file it is linked to is " profile.css" and the pictures are "tech3.jpg" and "profilepic.jpg".
